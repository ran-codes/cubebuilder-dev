field,description,coding
dataset_id,dataset id  e.g. APSL1AD. This should just be the name of the folder on the UHC server (minus the date appendix),
domain,Highest level of variable categorization. A list of these can be found at https://data.lacurbanhealth.org/data/about.,"Variables have at least one domain but can also be in multiple domains. Code domains as a string of domain names seperated by commas. For example:
   - ""Demographics"" (single domain variable
   - ""Demographics, Mortality"" (multiple domain variable)
"
subdomain,Lower level of variable categorization. A list of these can be found at https://data.lacurbanhealth.org/data/about.,"Variables have at least one subdomain but can also be in multiple subdomains. Code domains as a string of domain names seperated by commas. For example:
   - ""Population"" (single subdomain variable
   - ""Population, Migration"" (multiple subdomain variable)
"
var_label,Short human readable variable label.,Character. Aim to be less than 30 characters. Hard limit at 75 characters.
var_def,Details definition of what the variable is about. If categorical include coding here.,Character. No length limit.
value_type,What type of data is the value.,Must be one of the following: - double (continuous values) - discrete (integer values ) - categorical (non-numeric groups or categories)
units,This is the short label to be appended to the data value. It will be used for annotating text or visualizations with a unit label (e.g. cases per 100k).,Character
coding,This is an optional internal field that describes in details the measurement,Character
strata_description,This should describe in detail what strata are available for this variable. Please include details about each strata if applicable.,Character. Try to be as details as possible. If variable is not stratafied the value should be NA.
source,Data source,Character
dataset_notes,Any additional information can be added here. For example some dataset or file specific notes could be added here.,
limitations,Place to describe any limitaitons for this variable.,
acknowledgements,Any acklowdgements for this variable,
file_codebook,File name of the codebook file used for this dataset,
longitudinal,Is this variable qualified for longitudinal analysis or visualizations?,"Categorical: 
   1 - yes 
   0 - no  "
public,"The 'public' field in the dataset is a categorical variable that conveys the accessibility or visibility status of the data and codebooks. This field is essential for understanding any restrictions on data usage, sharing, or publication. It also helps users determine the appropriate handling procedures for the data, based on its sensitivity or confidentiality level.","Categorical: 
   0 - no. This data will not be made available for anyone.  But metadata will be made available. 
   1 - yes. This data and metadata will made available for public access. 
   2 - dmc only. The data will be made available only to DMC. Metadtaa will be made available publicly. 
   9 - Unknown. A placeholder indicicating uncertainty, this data will not be made vailable for public access.  But metadata will be made available. "
variable_origin,"The 'variable_origin' field in the dataset provides information about the nature of a given variable, indicating whether it is a primary (raw) variable or a derived (calculated) variable. Primary variables are directly collected or observed, while derived variables are generated by applying transformations, calculations, or algorithms to primary variables or other derived variables. This metadata field is crucial for understanding the data source and the data processing pipeline. It also helps in determining the reliability and reproducibility of the dataset.","Categorical: 
   primary - Indicates that the variable is a primary variable, obtained directly from data collection or observation. 
   var_name;var_name … etc - If derived, the accepted values are the names of the variables used in the transformation or calculation. The names of these variables should match the variable names used in the dataset. For example, if a derived variable is calculated using variables 'PRJT' and 'EMPL', the value for 'variable_origin' should be semicolan seperate list of origin variables ""PRJT; EMPL"""
