The latter variable is included because low school attendance among adolescents has been linked to poverty and early participation in the labor market, as well as exclusion from productive systems.  The score was created by summing the Z-scores for each component variable. Z-scores were created based on the distributions of all cities (L1AD) or all sub-cities (L2).

Each measure was transformed into a Z-score using the mean and standard deviation from the census data. Overcrowding was reverse coded such that the direction of all measures indicate a better social environment. The four measures were summed then divided by 4 assuming equal weights for all four measures.
